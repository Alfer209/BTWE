Because of this, it only makes sense to start our economic revival by improving our agricultural production rates and supporting our farmers."
 ARM_expand_railways:0 "Expand our Railways"
 ARM_expand_railways_desc:0 "Railways truly are a magnificent invention. They are by far one of the fastest and safest means of transportation and have revolutionised our day-to-day life.

 ARM_control_wheat_prices:0 "Control Wheat Prices"
 ARM_control_wheat_prices_desc:0 "With clear problems in agriculture, especially considering the failure of Ukrainian and German farming sectors, we cannot allow the market to depress our farmers even more. The Governor should put the wheat prices under control, before it is too late."

 ARM_develop_yerevan:0 "Develop Yerevan"
 ARM_develop_yerevan_desc:0 "To establish a modern Armenia, we must learn to build in new ways."
 ARM_mining_industry:0 "Start Rare Mineral Mining"
 ARM_mining_industry_desc:0 "Rare minerals are the hidden treasures buried deep beneath our soil. With modern technology and careful planning, we can finally begin to tap into these valuable resources.

 ARM_copper_mining:0 "Expand Copper Works"
 ARM_copper_mining_desc:0 "Copper has long been one of Armenia’s most important natural resources, and its demand continues to grow with industrialization. By modernizing and expanding our copper processing facilities, we can increase output and even extract other valuable materials in the process. This will boost our economy and support future military production."
 ARM_gold_mines:0 "Gold Mining"
 ARM_gold_mines_desc:0 "Gold has always captured the imagination, but in times of uncertainty, it offers more than just glitter-it offers stability. By investing in large-scale gold mining operations, we can unlock a valuable source of wealth, reduce our reliance on foreign capital, and stimulate domestic industry. A strong gold reserve will ease the economic burden on our people and grant us greater financial independence."
 ARM_urban_growth:0 "Urban Growth"
 ARM_urban_growth_desc:0 "As our nation modernizes, cities have become the beating heart of economic activity and cultural life. Encouraging urban development will help us absorb rural labor, expand our industrial base, and support a growing population. With careful planning, our cities can become centers of productivity and national pride."
 ARM_university_yerevan:0 "Expand the University of Yerevan"
 ARM_university_yerevan_desc:0 "The University of Yerevan, which was established in 1919, is by far the most modern and most important university of our country. An expansion of this institution would result in higher education being more easily accessible for the common people and would allow the university to offer a wider variety of different courses and degrees."
 ARM_nation_development:0 "Develop the Nation"
 ARM_nation_development_desc:0 "To secure our future, we must invest in the foundation of our economy. Building new factories and improving infrastructure will create jobs, stimulate trade, and strengthen our industrial capabilities. A more developed nation is a stronger nation-ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead."
 ARM_cement_factory:0 "Ararat Cement Factory"
 ARM_cement_factory_desc:0 "With construction on the rise across the country, the demand for building materials has never been higher.

This new facility will not only boost local industry but also support future development projects nationwide."
 ARM_hydroelectric_power:0 "Develop Hydroelectric Power"
 ARM_hydroelectric_power_desc:0 "Our rivers hold untapped potential-not just for irrigation, but for energy.

This move toward energy independence will accelerate construction, improve resource extraction, and power the next stage of national development."
 ARM_armenia_factories:0 "Factories of Yerevan"
 ARM_armenia_factories_desc:0 "As the capital and industrial heart of the nation, Yerevan is the ideal place to expand our manufacturing capabilities.

 ARM_finance_military:0 "Finance the Military"
 ARM_finance_military_desc:0 "A strong military requires more than just manpower-it demands steady funding and a reliable industrial base.

These investments will ensure our armed forces are well-equipped for whatever lies ahead."
 ARM_domestic_artillery:0 "Domestic Artillery Production"
 ARM_domestic_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery is the backbone of any effective military, and producing it locally will ensure that we are always well-equipped for any conflict. By establishing new production facilities and investing in research, we can both increase our output and improve the effectiveness of our artillery forces."
 ARM_armenia_arsenal:0 "Ammunition Factories"
 ARM_armenia_arsenal_desc:0 "An army is only as strong as the ammunition it has at its disposal. By investing in specialized ammunition factories, we can ensure that our troops are always well-supplied with the munitions they need to fight effectively. This expansion will improve our overall military production efficiency and accelerate the construction of future military factories."
 ARM_new_military_factories:0 "Armenia's Arsenal"
 ARM_new_military_factories_desc:0 "A good man might outweigh a good gun, but the two achieve far more."
 
 #### Military Focuses ####
 ARM_army_modern:0 "Begin Rearmament"
 ARM_army_modern_desc:0 "The world grows more dangerous by the day, we must be ready. It’s time to expand our armed forces and strengthen our industry to support them. By building new military infrastructure and preparing our population for service, we take the first step toward defending our nation."
 
 ####ARmy
 ARM_armenian_army:0 "The Armenian Army"
 ARM_armenian_army_desc:0 "We are surrounded by enemies on virtually all sides. There is only one thing that can save us from our foes: the Armenian Armed Forces. Our proud soldiers shall defend our country and teach our enemies the meaning of fear! They shall not back down and fight till their bones turn to dust!"
 ARM_unite_fedayi:0 "Unite the Fedayi"
 ARM_unite_fedayi_desc:0 "The term Fidayi describes Armenian civilians who left their homes and families in order to protect Armenia from the barbaric and bloodthirsty Turks. Now that Armenia has become a real nation, we have to unite these Irregulars into organised troops in order to lay the foundations of a modern and professional army that can defend our beloved country."
 ARM_decentralise_fedayi:0 "Keep the Fedayi Decentralized"
 ARM_decentralise_fedayi_desc:0 "Throughout the last few decades, the Fidayi, irregular units composed of Armenian volunteers, kept our nation and our people save from the Turkish oppressors. Without their protection, the Armenian people probably wouldn't exist anymore. So why should we change something about the way they operate? Haven't they proven their efficiency already?"
 ARM_integrate_militias:0 "Integrate the Militias"
 ARM_integrate_militias_desc:0 "Now that the Armenian army has been reorganized, we can begin to integrate the militia troops scattered throughout our country into a wider and better organised command structure. This will also allow us to use modern strategies on the battlefield, which will improve our chances of withstanding a potential invasion immensely."
 ARM_professional_army:0 "A Professional Army"
 ARM_professional_army_desc:0 "The core of every modern army is professionalism. Without discipline and proper training our soldiers will drop like flies and leave Armenia wide open to the enemy's forces. Let's bring our training methods up to today's standards and create an army that our people can be proud of!"
 ARM_tactics:0 "Adopt Guerilla tactics" 
 ARM_tactics_desc:0 "When fighting against a clearly superior foe, guerrilla warfare is by far the most efficient strategy to use. By ambushing our enemies where they would least expect it and by cutting off their supply lines, we can cause high casualties while suffering barely any ourselves. This will make the other nations think twice before attacking us!"
 ARM_call_to_arms:0 "A Call to Arms"
 ARM_call_to_arms:0 "It is the duty of every Armenian man to protect his country in its time of need. Every additional man on the front lines could potentially tip the scales and turn the tide of the war. If we all work together to achieve our common goal of an independent Armenian state, we cannot fail and cannot be broken!"
 ARM_mobalize_the_people:0 "Mobilize the People"
 ARM_mobalize_the_people_desc:0 "Many men have heeded [ARM.GetLeader]'s call to arms and are just waiting to be equipped and deployed on the front lines. We should organise these new recruits into small militia groups that can act independently from each other and thus react quickly and decisively on enemy movements."
 ARM_training_programs:0 "Improved Training Programms"
 ARM_training_programs_desc:0 "What our army lacks in quantity, it has to make up for in quality. Though our men have already proven their bravery and vigour on the fields of battle, this alone won't do. If our nation is to withstand the sands of time, then we need to invest in our soldiers' training and ensure that they are capable of defending their homes no matter what terrain, weather, or foe they have to face."
 ARM_army_hospitals:0 "Hospitals for the Wounded"
 ARM_army_hospitals_desc:0 "There is one resource that has become extremely rare in Armenia: manpower. To us, a single soldier is as valuable as a dozen battalions are to the Germans. We can't just simply leave the wounded to die on the fields. We have to take care of them, heal their wounds and get them back into shape. To that end, we should expand our hospitals and purchase better equipment for them."
 ARM_veteran_doctrine:0 "Learning from the Great War"
 ARM_veteran_doctrine_desc:0 "While a large part of our army consists of volunteers that signed up during our war of independence, there are also some among our ranks who have been a part of the Fidayi for decades. Their knowledge and experience could prove to be a vital advantage in the wars to come."
 ARM_military_school:0 "The Armenian Military School"
 ARM_military_school_desc:0 "An army is only as competent as its commanding officers. Our generals and field marshals have to be able to use certain strategies efficiently. To that end, we should establish a military school, where our officers will be taught modern strategies that can potentially save countless lives when used on the battlefield."
 ARM_organize_veterans:0 "Organize Dashnak Veterans"
 ARM_organize_veterans_desc:0 "The Dashnaks have fought in the name of the Armenian people for many years now. Even though this fight may not have been an open war but rather took the form of a resistance movement that launched a few small insurrections, the experience the Dashnaks have gathered throughout these years molded them into great fighters that can withstand even the most superior forces."
 ARM_mountain_training:0 "Mountain Training"
 ARM_mountain_training_desc:0 "A good part of our nation is covered in mountains towering above the surrounding highlands. Whilst this has some drawbacks, it also tremendously improves our defensive capabilities. By training our men to utilise this nigh impassable terrain against our enemies, we can ensure that our neighbours think twice about setting foot in our homeland."
 ARM_night_training:0 "Night Training"
 ARM_night_training_desc:0 "Ancient tales speak of lycanthropic beasts roaming swiftly through the night, striking their prey unseen, and escaping into the dark just as quickly as they appeared. Our soldiers, too, should learn to use the darkness of the night to their advantage, so that they can strike fear into the hearts of our enemies when they least expect it."
 ARM_strong_force:0 "A Necessary Force"
 ARM_strong_force_desc:0 "Even though some may not like it, we need an army to secure our place in the world. And not just any army - we need soldiers that are ready to defend their homeland no matter the cost. We need men that can carry the weight of our entire nation on their shoulders. And above anything else, we need a military that the people can put their trust in."
 ARM_develop_artillery:0 "Develop our Artillery"
 ARM_develop_artillery_desc:0 "One of the most efficient forms of support equipment is artillery. Throughout the years, this ranged weapon has constantly changed in terms of size, form and deadliness. Our artillery designs may not fall behind those of the other countries, lest our armies be overshadowed and outgunned by the enemies' soldiers."
 

 
 ####AIR
 ARM_armenian_airforce:0 "The Armenian Air Force"
 ARM_armenian_airforce_desc:0 "Modern wars are no longer solely decided by the men fighting on the land and on the seas, they can also be won up in the skies. A modern and efficient Air Force can harass hostile troops, cut of supply lines and even bomb the enemy into submission. However, an Air Force can also be very costly, and it takes both time and effort to construct one from scratch. The sooner we start drawing up plans, the better."
 ARM_build_radars:0 "Construct Radar Stations"
 ARM_build_radars_desc:0 "Radar stations as an invention are often underrated. While not directly contributing to the combat, they can decide the outcome of a battle by providing us with valuable information."
 ARM_yerevan_airport:0 "Expand the Air Bases"
 ARM_yerevan_airport_desc:0 "The newly reorganized Armenian Air Force needs a central base to operate from. By opening new airports we can kill two birds with one stone: Our Air Force could use these airports as headquarters for its operations and our government could use it to increase our import and export rates by opening it up to cargo planes."
 ARM_armenian_fighters:0 "Specialize on Smaller Aircraft"
 ARM_armenian_fighters_desc:0 "Just like our country itself, our industrial capabilities are quite small. Since we cannot afford to build resource-draining plane types such as heavy bombers or heavy fighters, we are more or less forced to specialise on smaller planes. However, we should not judge them by their size, since light fighters, reconnaissance planes, and the like can be just as valuable as larger aircraft if used correctly."
 ARM_our_own_airforce:0 "Building an Air Force"
 ARM_our_own_airforce_desc:0 "Obviously, an airport is not enough. The Armenian Air Force also needs planes in order to be able to conduct operations. The construction of workshops and factories specialised on producing and repairing airplanes fit for our military will guarantee that our pilots never run out of high quality aircraft."
 ARM_anti_air_focus:0 "Defend the Armenian Skies"
 ARM_anti_air_focus_desc:0 "Until now, we have focussed most of our defensive efforts on ground warfare and have mostly been building fortifications designed to counter infantry, artillery, tanks and suchlike. However, we also have to watch the skies and defend our cities from aerial bombardments, a goal which will require the use of stationary anti-air guns."
 ARM_air_recon:0 "Eyes in the Sky"
 ARM_air_recon_desc:0 "One of the most significant advantages of modern aircraft is that it can be used to spy on enemies from a safe distance. Reconnaissance planes, for example, are capable of gathering vital information without getting into firing range of the enemy on the ground. As Sun Tzu once said:0 "He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight." - and with our eyes up in the sky, we will always now when to fight."
 ARM_naval_bombers:0 "Over Land and Seas"
 ARM_naval_bombers_desc:0 "Air superiority is beginning to play an increasingly larger role, not just in land warfare but on the seas as well. If we hope to protect our waters from foreign intruders, we cannot rely solely on our navy, lest our ships be sunken to the depths of the ocean in one swift attack from above."

 
 ####NAVY
 ARM_armenian_navy:0 "The Armenian Navy"
 ARM_armenian_navy_desc:0 "We have secured ourselves a coastline. From potential trading partners to a strengthened military presence, this has opened up a great plethora of possibilities for our fledgling state and vastly reduced our reliance on our neighbours. We may still have our work cut out for us, but soon enough, the Armenian Navy shall take to the seas!"
 ARM_protect_waters:0 "Protecting Our Waters"
 ARM_protect_waters_desc:0 "We have our coast and have laid claim to our waters. Now, it is time that we focus on defending what we have gained. The construction of a few coastal fortifications should already go a long way, but if we truly seek to protect our interests and project our military prowess on the seas, then we will have to build up a strong and capable navy."
 ARM_merchant_navy:0 "The Merchant Navy"
 ARM_merchant_navy_desc:0 "We should seek to foster our economic growth by exploring the mercantile opportunities that lie across the sea. For that, we are going to need to build up a navy fit for shipping and trade - an investment that will soon enough pay its dividends."
 ARM_dockyard_infrastructure:0 "Develop Dockyard Infrastructure"
 ARM_dockyard_infrastructure_desc:0 "After the wars parts of our old harbours have fallen into disrepair, the roads have seen better days, and the coast's development stands halted. We should divert the necessary funds to alleviate these problems and use this opportunity to link it up with the rest of our country."
 ARM_modern_navy:0 "Towards a Modern Fleet"
 ARM_modern_navy_desc:0 "Our plans to defend our small portion of the seas cannot be realised if our ships are decades behind those of our neighbours. For our navy to stand a chance, it is paramount that we stay on top of the rapid technological developments made in the field of naval warfare."
 ARM_open_market:0 "Open Up Our Market"
 ARM_open_market_desc:0 "When foreign entrepreneurs think of Armenia, they shall think of a young and nigh-untouched market, filled to the brim with potential for investments. Similarly, the nations of the world shall see us as a trustworthy partner with whom they'd happily conduct business."
 ARM_naval_academy:0 "The Naval Academy"
 ARM_naval_academy_desc:0 "The Armenian navy is still young and our admiralty thus rather inexperienced. Whilst this problem cannot be solved in an instant, the opening of a naval academy will ensure that the Armenian admirals of tomorrow are ready for all that the sea might demand of them. After all, it is not just our ships but the brains behind them that have to defend our interests and bring honour to our name."
 ARM_our_own_navy:0 "A Navy of Our Own Making"
 ARM_our_own_navy_desc:0 "In a feat as important as the creation of our own navy, we can rely on no one but ourselves. As funding has already been diverted to the research of new designs and technologies, it is now just the production of the vessels envisioned by our engineers that still needs to be realised. By expanding our dockyards, we can soon begin assembling a small but mighty fleet."
 ARM_buy_ships:0 "Purchase Foreign Vessels"
 ARM_buy_ships_desc:0 "What we lack in industrial capacity can easily be made up for by our trustworthy allies. Unlike ourselves, they have a long history on the seas and proud naval traditions, so why shouldn't we use their knowledge, expertise, and industry to our advantage?"
 ARM_black_sea_ships:0 "Dominate the Black Sea"
 ARM_black_sea_ships_desc:0 "Modern naval warfare has many faces. Whilst the construction of larger ships would put an unbearable strain on our economy, keeping us from assembling a fleet in being, trade warfare is a strategy we can pursue. Smaller ships, striking our enemies where they are most vulnerable and retreating before their foe can retaliate. Soon enough, we shall make our enemies fear the waters that surround them!"
 ARM_navy_profits:0 "Trade Profits"
 ARM_navy_profits_desc:0 "We may not be as rich in natural resources or as much of an industrial powerhouse as other countries, but still, we have managed to turn a profit from what we have. By exploring new markets to sell our agricultural produce and the ores once slumbering beneath Armenian soil, we have created a steady stream of revenue - and as long as it is sustained, the financial reserves of our nation shall never run dry again!"
 
 

 
 ####ARM political

####Starting tree
 ARM_constitution:0 "Government Reforms"
 ARM_constitution_desc:0 "Armenia has secured its independence for a decade now, yet its government remains bogged down by outdated and inefficient administrative practices. To fix this, major reforms are being made to cut through old bureaucracy and create a more effective system. A stronger, more organized government will help the country stay stable and gain more political influence."
 ARM_lori_dilemma:0 "The Lori Dilemma"
 ARM_lori_dilemma_desc:0 "The Lori region is still a demilitarized zone, set up by the United Kingdom years ago. Now, Armenia has a choice: ask for British support to remove it and take full control or avoid conflict and leave things as they are. Moving forward could strengthen Armenia’s position, but it risks angering Georgia. Staying passive, however, would weaken the government’s authority and public confidence."
 

 ARM_establish_republic:0 "Democratic Republic of Armenia"
 ARM_establish_republic_desc:0 "In the aftermath of turbulent times, our nation embarks on a noble journey to re-establish the republic. Leaders call upon the inherent democratic spirit of the people, bolstering recruitable forces and stabilizing the homeland as the ideals of freedom and self-governance once again take root."
 ARM_unify_armenians:0 "Unify the Armenian People"
 ARM_unify_armenians_desc:0 "From the peaks of Ararat to the reclaimed lands of Kars and Nakhijevan, we unite Armenians at home and abroad. Factories shift to producing essentials, families grow stronger, and our churches inspire unity. Together, we strengthen our army, empower our leaders, and ensure Armenia thrives as one nation."
 
 
 ####Democracy path
 ARM_friend_communists:0 "Befriend the Communists"
 ARM_friend_communists_desc:0 "By aligning with socialist movements and Soviet defectors, Armenia secures workers’ support. Factories prioritize collective needs, while workers’ councils unite our people. Democratic reformers gain voice. Together, we forge stability through shared struggle and prove democracy can shield Armenia without bloodshed."
 ARM_friend_fascists:0 "Consolidate the Tseghakrons"
 ARM_friend_fascists_desc:0 "Under the iron discipline of the Tseghakron movement, we purge weakness from Armenia. Militias drill in the shadow of Ararat, conscripts swell our ranks, and traitors who embrace communism are silenced. To survive, Armenia must sharpen its sword and let faith in strength drown out calls for peace."
 ARM_arrest_criminals:0 "Crack Down on Corrupt Officials"
 ARM_arrest_criminals_desc:0 "Judges, journalists, and reformers unite to root out greed and incompetence. Courts publish all of their crimes, whistleblowers are hailed as heroes, and honest leaders reclaim Armenia’s future. As old networks crumble, the people cheer. Finally, a government worthy of their faith."
 ARM_homeland:0 "Our Homeland"
 ARM_homeland_desc:0 "From the mines of Syunik to the workshops of Yerevan, we rebuild Armenia’s heartland. Engineers revive abandoned factories and communities take pride in restoring what war once shattered. Unity turns rubble into progress and proves our soil holds wealth greater than invaders ever imagined."
 ARM_preserve_nation:0 "Preserve Our Nation"
 ARM_preserve_nation_desc:0 "Armenia’s churches, schools, and markets unite to defend our sovereignty. Trade deals favor Armenian hands, and elders teach the young to value unity over division. Though debates rage over how strictly to guard our borders, one truth binds all: survival demands harmony and harmony demands leaders who act, not argue."
 ARM_economy_reform:0 "Domestic Industries"
 ARM_economy_reform_desc:0 "Armenian engineers and laborers transform our workshops. Blueprints once gathering dust now guide assembly lines, apprentices master precision tools. Our pride grows with every tank or tractor built on Armenian soil."
 ARM_diaspora:0 "Utilize the Diaspora"
 ARM_diaspora_desc:0 "From Beirut to Boston, Armenian engineers, investors, and veterans aboard come back to fortify the homeland. Experienced officers train new recruits, and the donations rebuild villages. Our diaspora proves that distance cannot weaken Armenian blood."
 ARM_diaspora_funds:0 "Acquire Diaspora Funding"
 ARM_diaspora_funds_desc:0 "From Los Angeles to Paris, Armenian expatriates invest their wealth and skills into the homeland. Families sponsor schools instead of luxury imports. Turning Armenia into a beacon of innovation forged by hands from many different countries but loyal to one flag."
 ARM_minimum_wage:0 "Fair Minimum Wage"
 ARM_minimum_wage_desc:0 "Armenia’s workers march from factory floors to parliament, demanding pay that honors their sweat and skill. Owners grumble as profits dip, but productivity soars as fair wages buy loyalty, and loyalty makes rifles faster. With full stomachs and pride in honest labor the strikes fade."
 ARM_church_support:0 "Ensure Church Support"
 ARM_church_support_desc:0 "The Armenian Apostolic Church’s golden crosses rise over every village. Debates simmer over the church’s role but its blessing unites rich and poor alike, proving that even in modernity, Armenia’s soul remains its greatest weapon."
 ARM_christian_values:0 "Promote Christian Values"
 ARM_christian_values_desc:0 "Churches host community events, priests advocate for charity over corruption, and leaders frame laws through biblical principles of justice. Schools teach ethics and elders praise transparency. A nation rooted in shared virtue is a nation unshakable."
 ARM_join_allies:0 "Join the Allies"
 ARM_join_allies_desc:0 "With Soviet wolves at the door, Armenia turns westward. Diplomatic envoys sail to London, bearing maps of the Caucasus and pleas for protection."
 ARM_caucasus_pact:0 "Create a Transcaucasian Faction"
 ARM_caucasus_pact_desc:0 "Let the Caucasus Mountains echo with a new anthem-one of brotherhood, not bloodshed. We extend open hands to Tbilisi and Baku, urging Georgia and Azerbaijan to join us in forging a shared future. Through trade pacts, cultural exchanges, and a collective shield against foreign ambitions, we prove that Armenians, Georgians, and Azeris can thrive not as rivals, but as siblings."
 ARM_referendum_azr:0 "Referendum in Artsakh"
 ARM_referendum_azr_desc:0 "We dispatch diplomats to Baku, demanding the return of stolen lands-backed by maps etched in ancient stone and rifles shouldered by veterans of Soviet betrayal. Let the world witness a free vote: will Artsakh’s people choose Azerbaijan’s yoke or Armenia’s embrace? And let Azerbaijan choose wisely-denial will prove their tyranny, justifying the righteous steel of liberation."
 ARM_referendum_geo:0 "Javakhk for Guarantees"
 ARM_referendum_geo_desc:0 "The Javakh region, with its significant Armenian population, holds deep cultural and historical ties to our nation. Through careful diplomacy, we can propose a peaceful transfer of the territory in exchange for guaranteeing Georgia’s independence. If successful, this agreement will strengthen Armenian-Georgian relations and lay the groundwork for future military cooperation."
 ARM_wilsonian_armenia:0 "Shadow of Sevres"
 ARM_wilsonian_armenia_desc:0 "Let the world tremble as we resurrect the unfulfilled promise of 1920! Diplomats dispatch coded telegrams to Athens, London, and Paris, urging them to honor their century-old pledge. Together, we shall reclaim Armenia’s homeland stretching from sea to sacred mountain. But beware: the price of it is blood, and the wolves of Ankara will not die quietly."
 ARM_transcaucasian_deplomacy:0 "Transcaucasian Diplomacy"
 ARM_transcaucasian_deplomacy_desc:0 "Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia, once we were a united, but a short-lived state. This idea should be renewed and we should establish good diplomatic ties with our neighbors and resolve all territorial disputes."

 ARM_lori_triumph:0 "Triumph in Lori"
 ARM_lori_triumph_desc:0 "Against all odds, even as Georgia issued many warnings, we were successful in remilitarizing Lori, proving that the Armenian people and their leaders can overcome any obsticle in their way. This victory instills confidence in our people and inspires calls for bold, progressive change."
 ARM_lori_lost:0 "Growing Unrest"
 ARM_lori_lost_desc:0 "In the face of overwhelming external pressure and internal doubts over government strength, our leadership cedes Lori to Georgian demands. This capitulation shames the nation, exposing the state’s fragility and fueling a backlash among traditionalists and nationalists who demand a return to strong, uncompromising rule."
 ARM_mihran_elected:0 "Forward with the ARF"
 ARM_mihran_elected_desc:0 "In the aftermath of turbulent times, our nation embarks on a noble journey to re-establish the republic.

 ####communist Path
 
 ARM_communist_victory:0 "Shaumian’s Revolution"
 ARM_communist_victory_desc:0 "The people have spoken. The Communists have promised to completely reform the economy with an emphasis on a Marxist base and to take action against social inequality. Let's hope that they can achieve their goals and turn our state into the paradise Marx dreamed of!"
 ARM_national_industry:0 "Nationalize the Economy"
 ARM_national_industry_desc:0 "There is still a number of companies in our country trying to exploit the market for their own profit - disgusting and unacceptable behaviour! By nationalising these enterprises, we can guarantee that they only think about what is best for our country and our society while also controlling the implementation of workers' rights."
 ARM_collectivization:0 "Begin the Process of Collectivization"
 ARM_collectivization_desc:0 "How can we call ourselves a nation of equals when there are still some using their property for their own gains and not for the good of society? We have to clamp down on these selfish people by collectivising major factories and landholdings and directly integrating them into the state economy. After all, even though they may not believe us, it is only for their own good!"
 ARM_marxism_focus:0 "Marxist Guidance"
 ARM_marxism_focus_desc:0 "As Marx once said 'The meaning of peace is the absence of opposition to socialism.' Through our reforms we have managed to achieve proper peace. Workers throughout the country live under proper conditions and know that their work contributes to the wealth and prosperity of our society. The principles of Marx have not only become a part of the Armenian life, they have also become a part of the Armenian heart."
 ARM_socialist_reforms:0 "Introduce Socialist Reforms"
 ARM_socialist_reforms_desc:0 "When it comes to our social system, our country is still severely lacking in multiple aspects. If we want to increase the standard of living across the nation, we'll have to carry out some major reforms. For example, we should guarantee the freedom of religion, make healthcare more affordable and simplify the administration."
 ARM_labor_rights:0 "Codify Labour Rights"
 ARM_labor_rights_desc:0 "We cannot accept that some of our countrymen have to live in poverty while working full-time. Even though the workers are the backbone of our country, they are being treated worse than slaves. From now on, child labour will be officially forbidden, a minimum wage specified and a maximum number of work hours in a week established."

It asserts apostolic foundation, and its historical roots must be traced to the early and late Christianization of Iberia and Colchis by Saint Andrew in the 1st century AD and by Saint Nino in the 4th century AD, respectively. As in similar autocephalous Orthodox Christian churches, the church's highest governing body is the holy synod of bishops."

 ARM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the winter of 1920, British and French troops helped Armenian forces stop the Red Army at the South Caucasus. But a new threat came from the west: Kemalist Turkey. Outnumbered, Armenian soldiers gave up the lands promised by Sèvres to keep their core territory. At the Paris Peace Conference, Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a white peace, fixing their 1920 borders. \n\nSmall fights in Karabakh and Syunik still flare up. Now Armenia holds its ground in the mountains, ready for the next test."
 
 GEO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Georgia broke away during Russia’s civil war and in the chaos, Georgia turned to Germany for help. A short war with Armenia cost Georgia Lori and in January 1919, the British diplomats set up a neutral zone in Lori. The Menshevik government under Noe Zhordania’s Social Democrats crushed every uprising with force trying to keep Georgia stable. \n\nIn the tight 1935 election, they barely held their majority. Now in 1936, Georgia seems calm but the People want change."
 
 AZR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "From the flames of the Battle of Baku, the Azerbaijani Republic declared its freedom. But freedom without order is fragile. The army was still a band of wartime fighters. Democracy lived more in speeches than laws. And Karabakh’s separatists kept fighting. In 1920, Entente forces drove out the Bolsheviks. Now Baku’s leaders faced a choice to build real democracy, make friends with neighbors, and solve Karabakh peacefully. \n\nSmall border clashes with Armenia still haunt Karabakh. The choice ahead will decide if Azerbaijan becomes a beacon of hope."

###INTRO####
 armenia.1.d:0 "Armenia declared its independence on May 28, 1918, rising from the collapse of the Russian Empire and the failure of the Transcaucasian Federation. In the harsh early years of statehood, the young republic fought for survival against the Ottoman Empire, Azerbaijan, and internal instability. Yet Armenia endured. Through determined diplomacy and hard-fought victories, the Armenian forces secured Kars and Nakhchivan, strengthening the republic’s strategic position in the region. \n\nSince independence, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutyun) has governed the republic. Having guided the nation through war, famine, refugee crises, and political turmoil, the Dashnaks remain the dominant political force, though not without opposition. \n\nRelations with Georgia and Azerbaijan remain tense, strained by unresolved historical grievances and territorial disputes, even if open war has ceased. The threat of external intervention, whether from Bolshevik Russia, Turkey, or regional rivals continues to loom over the republic. \n\nNow, nearly two decades after independence, the future remains uncertain but hopeful. The Dashnaks claim they have preserved Armenian sovereignty against impossible odds. Whether they can maintain that unity and guide the nation through the storms gathering across the world remains to be seen."

 georgia.1.d:0 "Georgia gained its independence during the chaos of the Russian Civil War, following its break from the short-lived Transcaucasian Federation. During the chaos, Georgia went to Germany for help in defending against the enemies surrounding the nation. Following a short conflict with the Republic of Armenia, Georgia lost Lori, and has since remained a peaceful and stable state. \n\nWhile a part of Russia, Georgia was a centre of Menshevik activity, which remained the case when it gained independence, with the Menshehvik Social Democratic Party of Georgia ruling since 1918. Following Noe Ramishvili's brief stint as Chairman in 1918, Noe Zhordania has ruled the country for 18 years straight. The Mensheviks have had complete political dominance over Georgia the whole time, though their vote count has shrunk over the years. In the election of 1935, the Mensheviks almost lost their majority, but were able to keep hold. The popularity for a monarchy has grown over the years, with the two main candidates as king being George Bagration, head of the old Georgian royal family, the Bagrationi Dynasty and Teymuraz Bagration. \n\nGeorgia stands as a beacon of stability in a world of growing uncertainty. Late last year, the old and popular Noe Zhordania announced he would resign as Chairman, to be replaced by Noe Ramishvili, who has worked in Zhordania's government since independence, though is notably less popular than him. However, unless disaster were to suddenly strike the nation, nothing is set to change politically until the next election in 1939."

 azerbaijan.1.d:0 "Azerbaijan gained its independence on May 28, 1918, during the chaos of the Russian Civil War, after seceding from the short-lived Transcaucasian Federation. In June 1918 a treaty was signed with Turkey on the railroad and oil, and on June 26 the National Army was established. However, Azerbaijan was still unstable. In Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, power belonged to the so-called 'Baku Commune' - a group of Bolsheviks and Armenian Dashnaks. Already in July 1918, however, the power of the Bolsheviks fell, and the power went to the Tsentrokaspiy - the rule of the 5 Dictators, from the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries. \n\nFinally, Baku was captured on September 15, 1918 by the Caucasian Islamic Army and the Azerbaijani National Council took its rightful place as the supreme authority in Azerbaijan, led by its chairman, Fatali Khan Khoyski. On October 5, the oil was denationalized, and on November 19, the Azerbaijani Parliament - Majlis-Mabusan was convened. \n\nBut this was not the end of the era of chaos. Unresolved territorial disputes with Georgia and Armenia led Azerbaijan to fierce interethnic resistance. Throughout 1918 and 1919, Azerbaijani and Ottoman forces were embroiled in various border conflicts with Azerbaijan's neighbors - with Georgia over the Zakatala region and the Kura River valley, and with Armenia over Qarabag. \n\nSince 1918 the liberal Musavatist party has held power in the republic, but the party has had to concede much to the opposition in recent years, and it is possible that it will have great difficulty winning the next elections."

But now, confined to his home and unable to attend state functions, his presence is only felt in the legacy of his speeches and the shadows of his fading influence. Though no official statement has yet been made."

 armenia.61.t:0 "The Church Ascends"
 armenia.61.d:0 "After long centuries of statelessness, the Armenian Apostolic Church has assumed leadership of the nation. From the bustling streets of Yerevan to the sacred heights of Mount Ararat, the clergy takes up the mantle of governance, uniting the people under faith, law, and order. Catholicos Khoren I Muradbekian, spiritual leader of the Church, calls upon all Armenians to dedicate themselves to the restoration of their homeland and the renewal of its spiritual and cultural glory."

 armenia.62.d:0 "A royal envoy from the Bagratuni Kingdom has arrived in Ankara, delivering a firm diplomatic demand. The Kingdom insists on the return of the so called ‘Western Armenia’ including Van and Trabzon, claiming these territories as the rightful inheritance of the Armenian people. They invoke centuries of cultural, spiritual, and ancestral ties to the region, and subtly warn of consequences if this request is ignored."

 armenia.62.b:0 "This land is Turkish and will remain so."
 armenia.63.t:0 "Western Armenia Restored"
 armenia.63.d:0 "Against all expectations, the Turkish government has agreed to our demand. The sacred lands of Western Armenia, Mount Ararat’s shadow, the ruins of Ani, and the shores of Lake Van are once again under Armenian rule.

 armenia.63.a:0 "Our ancestors rejoice."
 armenia.64.t:0 "Ankara Rejects Our Claim"
 armenia.64.d:0 "The Turkish Republic has dismissed our demand for the return of Western Armenia, calling it ‘baseless historical fantasy.’ This insult to our people and denial of centuries of heritage leaves us with no peaceful path forward.

 armenia.73.t:0 "The Sèvres Conference Convened"
 armenia.73.d:0 "The delegations from both Greece and France have arrived in Yerevan without incident. The meeting is being held behind closed doors, away from curious eyes and unwanted attention.

 armenia.78.d:0 "With Istanbul under Armenian rule, an extraordinary proposal has arisen. Princess Dürrüşehvar Sultan, daughter of the last Ottoman Caliph, has been offered in marriage to His Majesty King Hakob Bagratuni. Such a union would unite two ancient dynasties, the Bagratuni and the Ottomans, reconciling centuries of conflict and symbolizing a new dawn for Anatolia."

 armenia.80.d:0 "Armenian envoys have arrived, speaking of shared faith, common heritage, and the restoration of ancient bonds between our peoples. They promise guidance and cooperation, yet some in the council fear that these words mask a deeper ambition.

The others, instead, suggest to create a defensive pact against any foreign aggression."
 armenia.90.a:0 "Caucasus should be united under one government."
 armenia.90.b:0 "We should establish a joint defensive pact."

 armenia.91.t:0 "Status of Transcaucasia - Single Government?"
 armenia.91.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has suggested that we should unite our forces and governments into a single Federation - similar to one that existed more than 20 years ago. Back then it was not a good idea, but today the situation is different."

 armenia.93.b:0 "Seems like we will have to use force..."

 armenia.94.t:0 "Failure of the Yerevan Conference!"
 armenia.94.d:0 "The Yerevan Conference has been doomed from the beginning. The Imperialist Armenian government just wanted to peacefully absorb our country, but they failed. Now they are going to attack us and take our territory by force!"
 armenia.94.a:0 "Are they serious?"

 armenia.95.t:0 "Question of Azerbaijan"

 armenia.99.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused the Conference suggestion, instead offering us to mutually guarantee each others independence and sign a non-aggression treaty. While this will definitely bring peace between our nations, it does not necessarily require the unification of our countries."
 armenia.99.a:0 "This is something at least."
 armenia.99.b:0 "Seems like we will have to use force..."
 
 armenia.100.t:0 "Armenia Issues Further Demands"
 armenia.100.d:0 "Despite our willingness to compromise and transfer Javakhketi in exchange for mutual non-aggression, the Armenian government has now submitted a new demand: the cession of the Shavsheti region.

 georgia.2.t:0 "Noe Zhordania Retires"
 georgia.2.d:0 "Noe Zhordania is stepping down as Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Georgia. He has ruled the nation for 18 years, and under him Georgia has become a strong and relatively stable nation. However, with his popularity beginning to faulter following some failed reforms and the economy stagnating, Zhordania decided it was his time to retire. His replacement, Noe Ramishvili, has worked closely with Zhordania over his 18 years of leadership, serving in his cabinet at Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Justice and Minister for Internal Affairs. Due to the relative stability of Georgia at the current time, and decent economic outlooks, the public should have time to get to like Ramishvili just as much as they like Zhordania."
 georgia.2.a:0 "Zhordania has served well."
 georgia.3.t:0 "Tbilisi Protests"
 georgia.3.d:0 "Thousands of people have gathered in Tbilisi this morning, protesting against the leadership of Noe Ramishvili. Some say he's purposely working against them for personal gain. These protests have been led by multiple of parties in Georgia, everywhere from Giorgi Bagration's Georgian traditionalists to Grigol Orjonikidze's SKP. Though wildly different, they all ask for the same thing, new elections. At the protests, the people spoke about how the situation of Georgia has changed since last year, and the current government is unfit to fix it. Evgeni has not commented yet."
 georgia.3.a:0 "This doesn't look good at all..."
 
 georgia.4.t:0 "Rising Unrest"
 georgia.4.d:0 "Tensions in Georgia's northern regions are escalating. In Abkhazia, various local groups have begun organizing more formally, demanding greater autonomy and openly challenging central authority. South Ossetia is even more volatile, with armed factions appearing and sporadic clashes with Georgian forces reported. The unrest is becoming increasingly coordinated, and the situation threatens to spiral out of control if left unchecked."
 georgia.4.a:0 "Could this get any worse?"
 
 georgia.5.t:0 "The Minority Situation Worsens"
 georgia.5.d:0 "The situation with the main minorities of Georgia has worsened greatly.  The People's Council of Abkhazia, a council set up representing the Abkhazian people, has officially stated support for organized groups as they have begun forming and coordinating their actions, posing a serious challenge to central authority. Protests have increased in Sukhumi in recent days, feeling empowered with the Council's support. Things are far worse in South Ossetia, however. With armed factions gaining strength and clashes with the Georgian Army becoming more frequent. If these groups are not dealt with swiftly, there is a real risk that both regions could rise in open rebellion."
 georgia.5.a:0 "Damn them."
 
 georgia.6.t:0 "Pressure Grows on Ramishvili to Call New Elections"
 georgia.6.d:0 "Pressure on Noe Ramishvili to call new elections has been increasing on all sides. Protests continue in Tbilisi and across the country, and some industries are talking of strikes against the government. The opposing parties in the National Council continue to call on the government to resign and for new elections. What is even more worrying, though, is the growth of resistance against Ramishvili by his own party. Multiple cabinet ministers are beginning to speak of how new elections might be best to try to preserve whats left of Georgian stability."
 georgia.6.a:0 "Maybe elections are necessary."
 georgia.7.t:0 "Noe Ramishvili Calls for New Elections"
 georgia.7.d:0 "Following the massive uproar throughout the nation against the current government, Chairman Ramishvili has reluctantly decided to call for new national elections. Though it is clear that the SSDP is unlikely to achieve a majority, if it even wins at all, the country could not go on without one."
 georgia.7.a:0 "It had to be done."
 georgia.8.t:0 "Protests End and Campaign Begins"
 georgia.8.d:0 "With the calling of new elections, the protests in Tbilisi and across the country have almost completely disappeared, with only a few stragglers left slowly petering out. Construction projects to repair the damage caused by the protests have already begun, as have the campaigns of the political parties. The minor parties are not likely to achieve anywhere close to a majority, and are instead potentially options for coalitions in a possible minority government. Ramishvili and the SSDP are running on a continuation of the current system and government, talking about the success Georgia has achieved in the past 18 years."
 georgia.8.a:0 "Peace returns to Tbilisi."
 georgia.9.t:0 "The Georgian Elections"
 georgia.9.d:0 "Following the chaos caused by the failures of the SSDP government, Noe Ramishvili was forced to call a new election, a election he knew he was likely to lose. Today, with people going out to the polls, it looks like it'll be close, with no party able to get a sole majority. Though it might be possible for the SSDP to scrape a minority victory."
 georgia.9.a:0 "The Menshevik SSDP survive with a minority."
 georgia.9.b:0 "The SKP managed to win."
 georgia.9.c:0 "The House of Mukhrani wins a majority."
 georgia.9.e:0 "The Tetri Giorgi, surprisingly."

 georgia.10.b:0 "Our claim to Lori stands."
 
 georgia.11.t:0 "Pacts Signed, Lori Returned"
 georgia.11.d:0 "At long last, Armenia has agreed to cede the Lori region back to Georgia in exchange for our solemn guarantee of their sovereignty and a non-aggression pact. Georgian and Armenian officials have just signed the treaties in Tbilisi. Our borders are now secure, and an era of mutual trust and stability dawns upon the Caucasus."
 georgia.11.a:0 "For Georgia and Armenia!"
 georgia.11.b:0 "Push further demands for Ardahan."
 
 georgia.12.t:0 "Offer Denied, Claims Remain"
 georgia.12.d:0 "Armenia has declined our generous proposal. By rejecting Georgia’s guarantee in exchange for Lori, they have left us with no choice but to press our territorial claim by other means."
 georgia.12.a:0 "Let us begin the preparations."
 
 georgia.13.t:0 "Simon Basaria Proclaims Independent Abkhazia!"

 georgia.15.a:0 "Maku is ours."
 georgia.16.t:0 "A Persian Rebuke"
 georgia.16.d:0 "Tehran has refused our ultimatum. The Shah’s ministers claim that Maku has been Persian soil for centuries, and they will not entertain any territorial revision."
 georgia.16.a:0 "Then we shall have it by force."
 
 georgia.17.t:0 "Our Snipers are Proving Highly Effective"
 georgia.17.d:0 "Reports have come in that our snipers are proving highly efficient at fighting of enemy forces intruding into our mountains. This is a good opportunity for war propaganda, as the term 'Georgian Reaper' has been propping up among enemy soldiers, referring to the dangers posed by Georgia's nature and people, and we could pin this to a certain person to rally the population if one happens to prop up."
 georgia.17.a:0 "Excellent!"
 georgia.17.b:0 "We should hand out more arms to the hunters."
 
 georgia.18.t:0 "Vasil Kvachantiradze accredited as the Georgian Reaper"

They argue that these lands share closer ethnic and geographic ties with the Caucasus than with the Russian heartland, and that their integration will strengthen regional unity and socialism."
 georgia.20.a:0 "We will help our ally."
 georgia.20.b:0 "It is not worth it."
 georgia.21.t:0 "Soviets Accept!"
 georgia.21.d:0 "We have successfully requested the transfer of the Northern Caucasus territories from the Soviet Union, and the Soviet government has agreed to our request.

 georgia.22.t:0 "Soviet Union Ignores Us"

 georgia.23.d:0 "We have fought for over two months now and with our troops disorganised and demoralized, some of our politicans have approached the government with an idea to sign a temporary truce with Abkhazia.

 azerbaijan.48.t:0 "The Military Takes Power"
 azerbaijan.48.d:0 "Over the past several years, the Azerbaijani armed forces have grown in prominence and public trust through disciplined leadership and effective reforms. Recent regional tensions and the increasing need for decisive national direction have convinced the military that it must assume the reins of government to safeguard the nation. General Aliagha Shikhlinski, celebrated for his service and vision, has taken the helm as interim leader.

 azerbaijan.51.t:0 "Azerbaijan Demands Southern Azerbaijan"
 azerbaijan.51.d:0 "The government in Baku has formally declared its desire to unite with the Azerbaijani population within our northern provinces. This brazen demand, presented as a call for national self-determination, is in reality nothing less than a direct challenge to our sovereignty."

 azerbaijan.60.d:0 "The capital was shaken today by a brutal act of terror. As Prime Minister Fatali Khan-Khoyski was leaving the Council of Ministers on the Parliament Street, he was struck by an assassin's bullet. Chaos erupted as security forces rushed him from the scene. Doctors report that Khoyski is in critical condition, and his survival remains uncertain. The attacker has not yet been identified, and rumors about Armenian connection swirl throughout the nation. The government declared a day of mourning - and a state of emergency in the districts bordering Qarabag."
 azerbaijan.60.a:0 "Pray for his recovery."
 
 azerbaijan.61.t:0 "Leadership Crisis"
 azerbaijan.61.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of physicians, Prime Minister Khoyski's condition has not improved.

 azerbaijan.64.t:0 "The Rise of Ittihad"
 azerbaijan.64.d:0 "For months, the Ittihad Party has been steadily gaining influence across the country. Their calls to return to Islamic traditions, support the imams, and build a stronger state rooted in faith have resonated deeply with a population weary of instability and outside influence. Local imams have rallied behind their message, and demonstrations in favor of religious renewal have spread throughout the cities and villages. Now, the old government finds itself unable to resist the tide. With mass support from the faithful, and crucial backing from the military and traditional elites, Ittihad has taken power. The new rulers declare that Azerbaijan will no longer be a mere republic built on foreign ideas, but reborn as the Caucasus Islamic State, a land united under God, the Quran, and the eternal guidance of Islam."

 azerbaijan.72.t:0 "Azerbaijan Proposes to Purchase Derbent"

 azerbaijan.73.t:0 "Moscow Accepts the Deal"

 azerbaijan.73.a:0 "A great day for Azerbaijan!"
 
 azerbaijan.74.t:0 "Moscow Rejects Our Offer"
 azerbaijan.74.d:0 "The Soviet Union has dismissed our proposal to purchase Derbent, refusing even to consider negotiations. Their rejection leaves little room for peaceful resolution."
 azerbaijan.74.a:0 "We will take it by force."
 
 azerbaijan.75.t:0 "Search for a Qajar Heir"
 azerbaijan.75.d:0 "To secure the dynasty’s future in Azerbaijan, we must locate a legitimate heir capable of uniting the people.

 azerbaijan.76.a:0 "Keep Baku as the Capital"
 azerbaijan.76.b:0 "Restore Tehran as the Capital"
 
 azerbaijan.77.t:0 "Investments in Shell Azerbaijan?"
 azerbaijan.77.d:0 "A delegation from distant Azerbaijan has arrived in The Hague today with an unexpected but highly lucrative offer for trade. Royal Dutch Shell has been engaged in oil production in Azerbaijan since the early years of the century, when it was still part of the Russian Empire. However, after the Great War, British influence in the region significantly increased, with some of our oil companies being acquired by them. The other part continued operating, but in a far more competitive and challenging environment. As a result, our earnings from oil production in Azerbaijan became insignificant compared to other regions. We even considered shutting down Royal Dutch Shell operations in Azerbaijan. Nonetheless, Azerbaijan now offers us an extraordinary opportunity - a kind of restart for our oil business. If we invest in their oil industry, Azerbaijan will be able to increase its oil production. This will be achieved through the nationalization of some foreign enterprises and the conclusion of new concession agreements, including those for production in the Caspian Sea. Failure to do so would likely result in Azerbaijan having to purchase our enterprises at a low cost."
 azerbaijan.77.a:0 "Sounds like a great deal."
 azerbaijan.77.b:0 "We are not interested."

 azerbaijan.78.t:0 "Success of the Negotiations"
 azerbaijan.78.d:0 "We have been able to reach a consensus with Royal Dutch Shell, who will now emerge as the primary foreign beneficiary of the region's oil production. Not only do we stand to receive a substantial portion, but we have secured a dependable European partner in this endeavor."
 azerbaijan.78.a:0 "We hope for a fruitful cooperation."

 azerbaijan.79.t:0 "Failure of the Negotiations"
 azerbaijan.79.d:0 "Regrettably, our discussions with the Dutch government regarding the future of Royal Dutch Shell have proven futile. [HOL.GetNameDefCap] has demonstrated a lack of interest in its own companies operating in our nation, and yesterday, the government announced the nationalization of Royal Dutch Shell’s oil production assets in accordance with previously agreed-upon arrangements with the Dutch side."
 azerbaijan.79.a:0 "Their loss."
 
 azerbaijan.80.t:0 "The Republic at the Brink"
 azerbaijan.80.d:0 "The situation is dire. Enemy forces press ever deeper into Anatolia, government authority is eroding, and the very survival of the Turkish state is now in question. While some argue that the republic must fight on regardless of the cost, others have begun to consider extraordinary measures to preserve Turkish statehood. Among these proposals is a controversial offer: political unification with Azerbaijan, framed not as surrender, but as a continuation of the republic under fraternal protection."
 azerbaijan.80.a:0 "Approach Azerbaijan with a proposal of unity."
 azerbaijan.80.b:0 "We will endure, whatever the cost."
 
 azerbaijan.81.t:0 "Turkish Proposal"
 azerbaijan.81.d:0 "Representatives of the Turkish government have approached Baku with an extraordinary request. With their republic on the verge of collapse, they propose a political union between Turkey and Azerbaijan, presented as a lawful continuation of Turkish statehood rather than an annexation."
 azerbaijan.81.a:0 "Accept the proposal."
 azerbaijan.81.b:0 "Decline."
 
 azerbaijan.82.t:0 "The Second Republic"
 azerbaijan.82.d:0 "Azerbaijan has agreed to our proposal. Through emergency legislation and mutual recognition, a new political framework has been established to ensure the survival of Turkish statehood. Though the price is steep and the future uncertain, Turkey has avoided annihilation."
 azerbaijan.82.a:0 "The republic survives."
 
 azerbaijan.83.t:0 "Azerbaijan Declined"
 azerbaijan.83.d:0 "Azerbaijan has declined our proposal. Whether out of caution or unwillingness to inherit our crisis, they have chosen not to intervene."
